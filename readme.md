# Investigate different image classification models

## Goals
**To evaluate and investigate the model:**
- Are there some classes tend to be confused with another?
- Visualise the convoluted images
- How does the overfitted models behave?
- How dynamic and correlated are the hidden units? 

**How do they change with different hyperparameters?**
